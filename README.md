# Image_Size_Compressor
Hi! this is a simple Python program which can be used to compress the size of an image. Here, in this program we'll have to provide an image(or URL address for accessing in cloud storage) and a location where you have to save the  compress image. This program is based on a simple Machine Learning technique known as Dimension Reduction and its working on Image processing has been done using Open CV.

Drawback :- The compressed size of the image is so random. Some time it is half of the original size of the image an some time it so no effect.
